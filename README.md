# LSTM implementation using NumPy

A Basic Implementation of the LSTM Forward Pass using NumPy and comparing the results with the LSTM model in PyTorch.
Manual Implementation of the Backward Pass for the training process through BPTT(BackPropogation Through Time) requires manual implementation of Automatic Differentiation. To be continued ...
